A OpenAI CustomGPT with vector stored knowledge base indexing. Built in PHP and a work in progress. 

**Work in progress**
This is a work in progress project. I aim to create a GPT chatbot thats easily customized. 
Why? Well, with this approach i am able to customize the chatbot for the current user using it
and/or whoever published it. This enables anyone to create no code ai chatbots based on custom data.

As an example this could be used to create a personal shopping assistant to existing ecommerce website, but with no code.

Clone repo to empty folder(such as www):
`git clone https://github.com/samuelgjekic/SamiCustomGPT.git .`
_If folder is not empty remove the dot in the end._

 ### **LLphant and OpenAI/PHP-Client**
 SamiCustomGPT uses the[ LLPhant](https://github.com/theodo-group/LLPhant) framework thats built on the OpenAi PHP Client library.
